                    <h2>Neutrality</h2>
                    <p>There is no such thing as neutrality, even in code (and technology more generally). Its design operates on a set of pre-assigned values and assumptions that are usually open for negotiation in the early days, before one design wins out over another and becomes normalised. The blockchain consensus algorithms are still very much open for debate, it is therefore essential in this period of time to look into and question what the assumptions and biases are of the different systems, what are their knock-on-effects (for example environmental), what types of behaviours are encouraged and discouraged and what is <strong>delegated</strong> to algorithms or what remains in the hands of institutions and humans.</p>
                    <p>Instead of assuming a system to be neutral, ask yourself, what are the biases?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How can these be made visible?</li>
                        <li>What needs to be <strong>disclosed</strong> in order for people to be able to understand, influence and possibly even change the assumptions down the line?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Delegation</h2>
                    <p>In the blockchain, functions that used to be performed by authorities and “legacy institutions” are delegated to new actors, some human, some code. When a decision is made by an algorithm instead of a legal institution, the nature of this decision changes dramatically. The ability for people to influence and respond to it changes too.</p>
                    <p>Consider what actions are being delegated to the code to execute and what that means in terms of accountability and access for different types of people. And consider also what are the new activities that humans have to take care of.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What are you delegating to the algorithm?</li>
                        <li>How does that affect accountability and access?</li>
                        <li>In what ways does that reshape the activities required of humans?</li>
                        <li>What is the quality and nature of these actions?</li>
                        <li>How does code change the quality and nature of the action?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Disclosure (Openness)</h2>
                    <p>If more and more actions and decisions are delegated to algorithms it becomes more and more important that people are able to see how these decisions are made in order to be able to have their say. This can vary across many different types of blockchain applications, and should depend on who they might affect.</p>
                    <p>All people affected should have some access to the information they need to understand and request necessary <strong>changes</strong> if they are negatively affected. This means to consider how people can understand a system, including what languages are used, what other explanations and context needs to be made clear and who should ideally be able to read and make sense of it.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who is affected by the system?</li>
                        <li>What is the minimum they need to know in order to be able to understand and have a say in what is affecting them?</li>
                        <li>What languages (code or human-based) are needed for explanations of the system and how it works to those affected?</li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
